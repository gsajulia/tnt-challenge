We can use querySelectorAll('p') with forEach(), with this we can iterate the array of paragraphs, so we use addEventListener to generate the click, but with an if on the outside with the restriction of (index !== (document. getElementsByTagName ('p'). length - 1)), with this it will only enter the logic to add the click if it is not the last element.
